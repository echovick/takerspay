## üß† Admin Dashboard Considerations

To improve the admin dashboard, consider the following:

-   **Contextual Filtering**: Allow switching views between **Crypto App** and **Financial App** modes for better segmentation.
-   **Wallet Insights**: Show wallet balances and usage by `type` (`nuban`, `fiat`, `crypto`) with context-aware dashboards.
-   **Order vs Transaction Tracking**: Separate analytics panels for **Crypto Orders** and **Finance Transactions**.
-   **Unified User Profiles**: Combine user-related data (wallets, bank accounts, orders, transactions, tickets) under a single profile view.
-   **Asset Management Tools**: Admin tools for managing crypto/gift card assets (prices, availability).
-   **Support Ticket Overview**: Dedicated ticket management interface for Finance App support operations.
-   **Audit & Logs**: Activity logs should reflect context (i.e., if actions are related to crypto vs finance).
-   **Tagging/Flagging**: Tag users, orders, or transactions as belonging to one app or both, for clarity.

## üìå Summary

This shared system provides flexibility and scalability by consolidating backend logic while serving distinct application use cases. By leveraging this structure, the admin dashboard can offer a powerful and unified interface with the clarity needed to manage both apps efficiently.
